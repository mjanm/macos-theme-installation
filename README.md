# macos-theme-installation
Install a macos theme in Linux Debian Editions


I wrote a short Linux Bash Skript to install a macOS Catalina or Ventura theme for Debian based systems.
You must be a root, so you can type 'sudo bash macos_theme_install.sh' or you use 'su', type in your password and run 'bash macos_theme_installation'.

Choose 'Ventura icon theme' [1] / 'Catalina icon theme' [2].


After the skrikpt is finished, you open 'themes' for cinnamon or other programms to manage your designs. Then choose!

If you want a bigger skript, example to install plank for a dock, let me know!
